IERS Conventions 2010 provides several routines for standard analysis at
    http://maia.usno.navy.mil/conv2010/software.html
these are compiled and linked together to one single library

A new version of the ETUTC routine must be produced whenever a new leap second
is announced.

There is a wrapper iers_warapper.h for using the IERS (FORTRAN) routines 
from C++. Furthermore, all of the routines/functions are in 
   namespace iers

Some of the original implementations had to be modified, e.g, ocean loading via 
HARDISP is only provided as a stand alone program. The modifications are:
   * converted PROGRAM HARDISP to SUBROUTINE HARDISP in HARDISP_ivg.F.
     Minimal changes have been done, although remaining code is superflous.


TODO
====
* testing of vienna mapping vunctions vmf1_ and vmf1_ht
* comparison of XHF2002_IERS with SOFA library
