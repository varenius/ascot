   The following code basically follows the algorithm set forth in
the above reference.  I did modify it a little by not exactly using
Simpson's rule for integration in its "usual" form.  Instead,  the
code uses Simpson's rule over a given interval,  and compares the
result to that which you would get from the trapezoidal rule
(integral evaluated using just the endpoints.)  If the difference is
greater than a certain tolerance,  the region is split in half and
the total_refraction() function recurses.

   The benefit of this is that the region is recursively subdivided,
with most of the evaluation being done in the places where the
function is changing most rapidly.  I'm sure it's not an original
idea,  but it does seem to improve performance a bit.

   Another benefit comes into play when the iterative procedure at
(3.281-5) is done,  to determine the value of 'r' corresponding to
a given value of 'z'.  With this "subdivision" technique,  we're
looking at an intermediate value of z (between the two endpoints),
and an excellent starting point is the intermediate value of r.
This better initial value in the iteration saves us a few steps.

   NOTE that situations with observed_alt < 0. (i.e.,  looking
"below" the horizon,  zenith angle greater than 90 degrees) or
height_in_meters > 11000 (i.e.,  above the troposphere) are not
handled properly and will usually return garbage results.
'observed_alt < 0.' can happen,  for example, if you're on top of
Mauna Kea looking out over the Pacific.  If you hand the routine
something like observed_alt = -55 (i.e.,  looking downward into
the earth),  it will gamely figure out what the refraction would
be if the earth's atmosphere continued downward,  gradually
increasing in pressure.  In this mathematical model,  the index
of refraction would increase greatly,  so it would be like looking
downward into a mirrored surface;  the ray of light would bend
_up_,  eventually exiting at your level at observed_alt = +55.
Thus,  for observed_alt = -55,  the refraction is about 110 degrees.

   Also, the curvature of the earth isn't handled;  the refraction
is of the sort you'd get with a flat earth.

   All of these problems could be fixed,  but it would require some
tinkering with the _Explanatory Supplement_ algorithm. */
