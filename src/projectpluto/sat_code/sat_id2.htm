<h1> On-line artificial satellite identification </h1>

<p> This is an on-line version of the <a href="sat_id.htm"> <tt> sat_id
</tt> </a> program used for identifying artificial satellites found
by asteroid observers.  Use the form below to find which artsats match
the position/motion of objects you've observed. </p>

<p> Suggested quick start:  <b>Don't panic!</b>  Copy/paste your observations in the
large text window below, <em> or </em> click on "Browse" to pick a file
containing the astrometry.  Then click the "find matching artsats"
button.  That will probably be all you need. </p>

<p> The output will show each line of astrometry,  followed by the object(s)
within the specified angular distance and a little information about them.
If you supply more than one position (which I strongly recommend),  the apparent
motion of "your" object will be shown,  and you can compare it to the motion
of the possible matching artsats. </p>

<p> Be warned:  as currently written,  the program uses "recent" elements for
almost all objects.  Which means that if you feed it observations made a month
ago,  it'll probably fail.  Also,  it times out after 15 seconds,  so don't
try to feed it too many observations at once. </p>

<p> If you're still not getting things to work,  contact me at

(modified to baffle spammers). </p>

other text is copied in as well;  extra text will simply be disregarded.
